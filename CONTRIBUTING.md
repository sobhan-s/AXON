🐛 How to Report a Bug

    Check for duplicates: Search existing GitHub Issues to see if the bug has already been reported.
    Be specific: Use a clear and descriptive title.
    Steps to reproduce: Provide a numbered list of steps, the expected result, and what actually happened.
    Include environment details: Mention your OS, language version, or browser (e.g., Windows 11, Python 3.10).

💡 How to Suggest a New Feature

    Open an Issue: Explain why this feature is needed and how it would work.
    Draft a "User Story": "As a user, I want to [action] so that [benefit]."
    Wait for feedback: Let’s discuss the scope before you start writing the code!

🛠 Coding Style & Testing

    Consistency is king: Follow the existing indentation and naming conventions (e.g., CamelCase vs snake_case) already used in the repo.
    Keep it clean: Avoid adding unnecessary comments or "dead code" that is commented out.
    Test your changes: Ensure your code runs without errors. If we have a tests/ folder, run the existing suite using the GitHub Actions or local commands.
    One PR per feature: Don't bundle five different fixes into one Pull Request; keep them small and focused.
